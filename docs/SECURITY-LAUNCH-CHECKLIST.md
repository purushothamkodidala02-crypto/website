# Varadhi Prep security launch checklist

Complete these dashboard settings before pointing `varadhiprep.in` to production.

## Supabase Authentication

- Set **Authentication → URL Configuration → Site URL** to `https://varadhiprep.in`. Allow `https://varadhiprep.in/auth/recovery**` and `http://localhost:3000/**` as redirect URLs.
- In **Authentication → Email Templates → Reset password**, use the device-independent recovery link documented below. Disable click tracking for authentication emails in Brevo because rewritten or prefetched one-time links can fail.
- Reset-password email link: `<a href="{{ .RedirectTo }}&amp;token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&amp;type=recovery">Reset password</a>`. The recovery callback deliberately waits for a POST confirmation before consuming the one-time token.

- Keep **Confirm email** enabled after Brevo SMTP is working.
- Set minimum password length to **10**. Enable leaked-password protection when the Supabase plan supports it.
- Create a free Cloudflare Turnstile Managed widget for `varadhiprep.in` and `www.varadhiprep.in`.
- Add its public site key to Vercel as `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`.
- In Supabase **Authentication → Attack Protection**, enable CAPTCHA, choose Cloudflare Turnstile, and paste the private Turnstile secret. Never add that secret to source code or a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.
- Review Auth rate limits for sign-in, sign-up, resend and password recovery. Begin conservatively and monitor legitimate failures.
- Restrict redirect URLs to `https://varadhiprep.in/**`, `https://www.varadhiprep.in/**`, the active Vercel production URL, and localhost development URLs only.
- Require MFA for every administrator account. Student MFA can remain optional.

## Database

- Apply every migration through `20260811233000_prelaunch_test_engine_hardening.sql` before deploying the matching application code.
- Confirm the new transactional functions exist: `publish_mock_test_safely`, `import_questions_atomic`, and `create_exam_structure_atomic`.
- Verify `profiles` has no INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE grant for `anon` or `authenticated`.
- Verify students cannot select `questions`, `mock_test_questions`, session snapshots, or another student's attempts directly.
- Enable Supabase backups and record a restore test before launch.

## Vercel and domain

- Store secrets only in Vercel environment variables; never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for private keys.
- Keep Preview and Production environment variables separate.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://varadhiprep.in` in Production.
- Add `varadhiprep.in` and `www.varadhiprep.in` to the Vercel project, then copy Vercel's exact DNS records into the domain registrar.
- Confirm HTTPS before enabling the domain for students. The application sends HSTS in production.
- Redirect `www.varadhiprep.in` to the canonical host `https://varadhiprep.in`.
- Keep the current Vercel production hostname in the Turnstile widget until the custom domain is verified; add both custom hostnames before switching traffic.

## Operations

- Review Supabase Auth and Database logs weekly and after every suspicious report.
- Remove unused admin accounts immediately.
- Rotate Brevo and Supabase credentials if they are ever pasted into chat, source code, or screenshots.
- Run `npm run verify` and `npm audit --omit=dev` before every deployment.
